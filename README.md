# EduPath - Univesity Finder Web Application
This  project  is  aimed  to  be  a  one-stop  destination  for  students  to  find  out  their  desired programmes  and  school  to  pursue  after  graduating.

## How It's Made:
Tech used: ASP.NET, C#, Python
I used ASP.NET to build this web application for my final year project after learning in university. The objectives of the application was to provide web-based information on programmes and universities, implement search function, develop compare programmes function, help identify programme path through a  10-question  multiple-choice  survey, and enable an AI Chatbot to answer queries.

Later, the scope of the project was defined in modules: 
1. Account Module
2. University Module
3. Course Module
4. AI Chatbot Module
5. Personality Test Module


The main focus of the system was the centralised university database that offers a variety of programmes and university options with completed and up-to-date information. Therefore, the first thing I did was searching for the dataset which will be use for the database to display universities and programmes in Malaysia. Then, I planned out the database structure using an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD). To keep the information up-to-date, the administrator are able to update the dataset in the database.

## Lessons Learned:
At the beginning, I faced many difficulties such as not finding a suitable dataset, not being able to build my project in a timely and high quality manner. However, through constant efforts and determination, I managed to pull though completing and deliver my project before the deadline and demostrated it to my supervisor. After completing this project, I was left with satisfaction over my accompplishments. Although there are some minor flaws, such as the chatbot providing inaccurate responses on the enquire of programme entry requirements, the dataset are not up-to-date, I am pretty happy with the overall system.

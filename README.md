# UniFinder - Univesity Finder Web Application
This  project  is  aimed  to  be  a  one-stop  destination  for  students  to  find  out  their  desired programmes  and  school  to  pursue  after  graduating.

## How It's Made:
Tech used: ASP.NET, C#, Python
I used ASP.NET to build this web application for my final year project after learning in university. The objectives of the application was to provide web-based information on programmes and universities, implement search function, develop compare programmes function, help identify programme path through a  10-question  multiple-choice  survey, and enable an AI Chatbot to answer queries.

Later, the scope of the project was defined in modules: 
1. Account Module
2. University Module
3. Course Module
4. AI Chatbot Module
5. Personality Test Module


The main focus of the system was the centralised university database that offers a variety of programmes and university options with completed and up-to-date information. Therefore, the first thing I did was searching for the dataset which will be use for the database to display universities and programmes in Malaysia. Then, I planned out the database structure using an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD). To keep the information up-to-date, the administrator are able to update the dataset in the database.
